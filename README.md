# Financial-Management-Modeling

Excel is a powerful tool that allows users to create, manage, and analyze data in a tabular format.

During my Economics academic journey, I solved different Financial exercises. In this repository you will find exercises and solutions for this problems:

* Capital Budgeting: a financial process used by companies to evaluate and make decisions about long-term investments in projects or assets. The goal of this problem is to maximize the Net Present Value (NPV), following specific business constraints.
* Conditional Probabilities: refer to the probabilities of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. It involves assessing the likelihood of a specific outcome or event under the condition that certain information or criteria are known. Conditional probabilities are particularly relevant in decision-making and risk management within business contexts.
* Decision Tree: a graphical representation of decision-making processes that utilizes branches and nodes to illustrate possible outcomes, choices, and their associated probabilities or values. It is a visual tool used in various fields, including business, finance, and machine learning, to map out decisions and their consequences in a structured and easily interpretable format.
* Linear Programming and Integer Linear Programming: Linear Programming is a mathematical method for optimizing a linear objective function, subject to a set of linear equality and inequality constraints. It is widely used in operations research, economics, and management to find the best outcome in a model with linear relationships. Integer Linear Programming extends linear programming by adding the requirement that some or all decision variables must take on integer values. This is particularly useful when dealing with problems where solutions need to be whole numbers, such as in project scheduling or discrete resource allocation.
* Regression Analysis: a statistical technique that examines the relationship between one or more independent variables and a dependent variable, aiming to model and quantify the strength and nature of that relationship.
* Markowitz Optimal Portoflio: introduced by Harry Markowitz, is a concept in finance that involves selecting a portfolio of assets to maximize expected return while minimizing risk. This portfolio is characterized by the efficient frontier, representing the set of portfolios with the highest expected return for a given level of risk or the lowest risk for a given level of expected return.
* Decision Analysis through Maximax, Maximin, Minimax: involves evaluating alternative courses of action based on different decision criteria. Maximax is an optimistic decision strategy that selects the alternative with the maximum possible payoff or benefit under the assumption of the best possible future conditions. Maximin is a conservative decision strategy that selects the alternative with the maximum minimum payoff, focusing on minimizing the potential loss or downside. Minimax is a strategy that considers the minimum maximum loss, aiming to minimize the maximum regret or potential negative impact.
* Monte Carlo Simulation: a computational technique that uses random sampling and probability distributions to model and analyze the impact of uncertainty and variability in various systems. It involves running multiple simulations of a given scenario to estimate the range of possible outcomes and their associated probabilities. Monte Carlo simulations are widely used in fields such as finance, engineering, and operations research for decision-making, risk assessment, and performance optimization.
